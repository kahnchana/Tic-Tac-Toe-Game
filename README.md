# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

It's a computer played version of the well-known game, tic tac toe. I made it for fun. Special thing is I just used basic stuff in python for everything. 

And there's a two player version of it as well. 

The exe is for the single player one. You can just download it and play it :)
